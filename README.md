The Hare Krishna mantra is composed of Sanskrit names in the singular vocative case: Hare, Krishna, and Rama (in Anglicized spelling). It is a poetic stanza in anuṣṭubh meter (a quatrain of four lines (pāda) of eight syllables with certain syllable lengths for some of the syllables).

The actual mantra in the Upanishad is as follows:[1][5]

    '’Hare Rāma Hare Rāma
    Rāma Rāma Hare Hare
    Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa
    Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare
    — Kali-Saṇṭāraṇa Upaniṣad

When Sri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu promulgated the Mahamantra, it was rendered with Krishna's name's first.


    Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa
    Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare
    Hare Rāma Hare Rāma
    Rāma Rāma Hare Hare
